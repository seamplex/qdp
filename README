quick & dirty plot
==================

qdp is a bash script that interfaces with pyxplot (http://pyxplot.org.uk)
so as to generate scientific plots from the commandline. As pyxplot
itself, qdp has some defaults that should satisfy the user more often
than not. If it is not the case, there are plenty of commandline options
that control how the plots are generated. The output consists of both
a PDF and a PNG file with the plot.

In any case, as its name suggest, qdp is _quick_ and _dirty_ so if
something does not work as you expect, feel free to modify it to suit
your needs. It was originally written to enhance the scriptability of
wasora (http://www.talador.com.ar/jeremy/wasora).
