quick & dirty plot
==================

qdp is a shell script that interfaces with pyxplot (http://pyxplot.org.uk)
so as to generate scientific plots from the commandline. As pyxplot
itself, qdp has some defaults that should satisfy the user more often
than not. If it is not the case, there are plenty of commandline options
that control how the plots are generated. The output consists of both
a PDF and a PNG file with the plot.

In any case, as its name suggest, qdp is _quick_ and _dirty_ so if
something does not work as you expect, feel free to modify it to suit
your needs. It was originally written to enhance the scriptability of
wasora (http://www.talador.com.ar/jeremy/wasora).

Check the usage and available options with the -h option:

    $ ./qdp -h
    usage: ./qdp [options] [-o output] [datafile]
     no datafile indicates stdin
     if no output is given, basename is assumed equal to datafile
     if neither output nor datafile given, basename output is qdp
         --xcol <int>            set x column in datafile, default 1
         --ycol <int>            set y columns in datafile, default 2
         --xlabel <string>       set x axis label, default none
         --ylabel <string>       set y axis label, default none
         --xrange <range>        set x axis range, default auto
         --yrange <range>        set y axis range, default auto
         --with <string>         set with, default linespoints
         --lt <string>           set linetype, default 1
         --lw <float>            set linewdith, default 1
         --plw <float>           set pointlinewdiths
         --ps <float>            set pointsizes
         --pt <int>              set pointtype
         --pi <int>              set pointinterval (extension to pyxplot)
         --color <string>        set colors
         --ti <string>           set data title, default none
         --plottitle <string>    set plot title, default none
         --key <string>          set key location, default top right
         --header <file>         use <file> as template instead of default
